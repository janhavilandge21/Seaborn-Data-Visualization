📊 Seaborn Data Visualization Project
This project demonstrates various data visualization techniques using Seaborn in Python. It explores multiple built-in datasets such as tips, titanic, etc., and visualizes relationships and distributions using different plot types.

📸 Sample Visualizations
Scatter plot showing relationship between total bill and tip with hue and size

Line plot showing total bill by size, separated by gender

Box and violin plots comparing tip amounts by day and smoker/time status

Regression plot with trend lines

KDE and histogram for density estimation

FacetGrid for multi-dimensional plotting
